# drv8833
This package is a [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org) driver for the TI DRV8833 dual h-bridge chip able to drive DC motors, bipolar steppers, solenoids, and other inductive loads.

The chip has a power supply range from 2.7v - 10.8v. Included are methods that seem appropriate to motors and solenoids, with and without PWM, but may need some more work to support steppers.
